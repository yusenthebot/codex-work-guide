# Top-Conference Computer-Science Figure Style

Use this guide when the user asks for a figure suitable for a computer-science paper, top conference, camera-ready paper, method overview, system architecture, ML pipeline, multimodal model, agent workflow, or benchmark/evaluation figure.

## Default Style Contract

When the user provides no style reference, use `figure-contract.md` as the visual baseline. Preserve the user's method and derive layout, density, hierarchy, and component vocabulary from the semantic brief.

## When Input Is Underspecified

Style can be inferred; scientific content cannot.

If the user provides a goal but not a style, apply the default style contract. If the user omits core content such as modules, data flow, training stages, variables, losses, or architecture boundaries, ask for that missing content or make a clearly labeled conservative assumption in the brief.

Never invent a paper contribution, dataset, metric, loss, theorem, or module name just to fill a polished layout.

## Visual Language

- Prefer a wide landscape canvas for method overview figures and a multi-panel layout for dense methods.
- Use clear section labels such as `(a) Overall Architecture`, `Stage 1`, `Stage 2`, `Training`, `Inference`, or `Online Serving` when they match the content.
- Use muted academic palettes: pale blue, teal, green, orange, yellow, lavender, and light gray, with dark strokes and high-contrast text.
- Use dashed containers for groups, memory banks, prompt pools, datasets, reward models, or optional branches.

### The First Principle: Every Visual Element Must Mean Something

**A figure is not a decoration. Every shape, color, arrow, and icon must carry semantic load.** If you cannot answer "what does this element represent in the method?" in one sentence, the element must not exist. Drawing meaningless colored blocks to "look like a paper figure" is the single most common amateur failure — it produces noise, not communication.

Reference figures look good **because every element earns its place**. The token bars in a transformer paper represent actual token sequences. The matrix grids represent actual tensors. The stacked cards represent actual hierarchical levels. They are not "paper-figure-ish decorations" — they are the data itself, drawn. Copying the visual form without the semantic content produces a figure that looks busy but says nothing.

### What To Learn From Reference Images (And What NOT To Learn)

**Learn the essence, not the surface:**

| DO learn from the reference | DO NOT copy from the reference |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Overall composition and region hierarchy | Specific decorative shapes (token bars, matrix grids) unless your content has the same semantics |
| Whitespace rhythm and spacing discipline | Colorful blocks that have no meaning in your diagram |
| Font hierarchy (heading / subheading / body / caption sizes) | Layouts whose regions only make sense for the reference's topic |
| Arrow grammar (how data/control/feedback are distinguished) | The reference's exact labels or terminology |
| Palette coherence (muted, intentional, 5-8 colors) | Decorative gradients or rainbow strips |
| Density calibration (how much content fits per square inch) | Stacked cards or mini-tables with no data behind them |
| How every element is placed exactly where it belongs | Pure-color squares "because the reference had small squares" |

The reference figure is good because **the composition, spacing, typography, arrow language, and palette are perfect AND every element has a reason to exist.** The small squares in the reference are good because they represent tokens. The same squares in your diagram are garbage because they represent nothing.

### When Token Bars / Matrix Grids / Stacked Cards Are Justified

Use these visual forms **only when your content actually has the corresponding semantics:**

- **Token bars** — only when your method processes a discrete token sequence (LLM input/output, sequence models). Each cell should be a token or a position. Do not draw empty colored cells.
- **Matrix grids** — only when your method operates on an actual matrix/tensor (attention maps, weight matrices, feature maps). Each cell should be labeled or axis-annotated. Do not draw a rainbow grid "for show."
- **Mini tables** — only when you have actual tabular data (hyperparameters, benchmark results, dataset stats). Headers and rows must be real.
- **Stacked cards** — only when representing an actual hierarchy or stack of layers (memory levels, encoder layers). Each card must be labeled with its level.
- **Small legends** — only when the figure uses color coding that needs explanation. Every legend entry must map to a real category in the figure.

**Before drawing any of these, answer in the brief:**
> "This [token bar / matrix / table / card stack] represents [concrete thing in the user's method], and each cell/row/level corresponds to [concrete unit]."

If you cannot fill that sentence with real content, **do not draw the element.** Use a labeled box with a text description instead. A labeled box that says "Token sequence (T=128)" is always better than a rainbow strip that says nothing.

### What "Looking Like A Paper Figure" Actually Requires

Amateur agents think a figure looks like a paper figure because it has small colored shapes. Wrong. A figure looks like a paper figure because:

1. **Composition is deliberate** — regions are placed with intent, not scattered. Hierarchy reads top-to-bottom or left-to-right cleanly.
2. **Whitespace is generous and even** — no cramped corners, no cavernous empty boxes, no inconsistent margins.
3. **Typography has clear hierarchy** — heading > subheading > body > caption, each at a deliberate size, consistently applied.
4. **Palette is muted and coherent** — 5-8 colors that form a family, each used for a semantic category, not one random color per shape.
5. **Arrows are precise** — every arrow has a source, a target, a direction, and a meaning. No arrow crosses a box or text. No arrow is decorative.
6. **Every element earns its place** — nothing is there "to look full." If you removed any element, the figure would lose information.
7. **Density matches content** — not sparse (4 boxes on a huge canvas), not crammed (50 elements overlapping). Each element has room to breathe.

Master these seven and your figure looks like a top-conference figure — with or without token bars. Master none of them and no amount of colored squares will save you.

- Use equations sparingly and place them near the arrow or block they explain.
- Use consistent arrow semantics: data flow, control flow, feedback, update/writeback, loss, reward, and retrieval should be visually distinguishable.
- Prefer editable primitives for recurring elements. Use bundled SVG icons only when a primitive approximation would be slower or less clear.

## Top-Conference Quality Bar

Before handoff, the latest screenshot must satisfy:

- no clipped labels, hidden text, accidental overlaps, or arrows crossing labels
- every connector has a defined source, target, direction, and semantic meaning
- subfigure labels, legends, equations, and color coding are internally consistent
- the figure reads at paper scale: important text remains legible when the screenshot is scaled down
- the `.drawio` passes `scripts/validate_drawio.py`; use `--strict` for final camera-ready work when warnings should block handoff
