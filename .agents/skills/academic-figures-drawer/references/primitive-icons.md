# Editable Primitive Icon Recipes

Use these recipes when a research figure needs small icons but exact source assets are unavailable. The goal is not decorative icon design; the goal is consistent, editable, recognizable primitives that survive draw.io editing and screenshot comparison.

Use this file when an icon should be built from editable draw.io cells or when the reference has a hand-built paper-figure style. Prefer primitives over external assets unless the user supplies a required logo or image.

## Rules

- Build icons from draw.io rectangles, ellipses, triangles, lines, arcs/connectors, and short text glyphs.
- Keep each icon inside an explicit bounding box `(x, y, w, h)` and record that box in `asset-ledger.md`.
- Use the same stroke width, corner radius, and scale for repeated icons in one figure.
- Put icon cells above background fills and below labels unless the reference places labels inside the icon.
- Do not use a generic symbol when the reference meaning is specific. If the recipe is insufficient, list the gap in `asset-ledger.md`.

Default small-icon style:

```text
strokeColor=#4f5d6b;strokeWidth=1.5;fillColor=#ffffff;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;
```

Scale the coordinates below from a `24 x 24` box unless noted.

## Document Or Text

Meaning: note, instruction, title, record, text stream.

Cells:

- page rectangle: `x+4,y+3,w=16,h=18`, white fill, gray stroke
- folded corner triangle: points near `(x+15,y+3) -> (x+20,y+8) -> (x+15,y+8)`, pale fill
- text lines: three thin horizontal lines at `y+9`, `y+13`, `y+17`

Use for: paper sheets, "note content", instruction cards.

## Image

Meaning: image modality, screenshot, visual input.

Cells:

- frame rectangle: `x+3,y+4,w=18,h=16`
- sun dot: small ellipse `x+15,y+7,w=3,h=3`
- mountain polyline: `(x+5,y+18) -> (x+10,y+12) -> (x+14,y+16) -> (x+18,y+10) -> (x+21,y+18)`

Use muted blue or pale cyan fills when the reference uses modality colors.

## Audio

Meaning: audio modality or sound token.

Cells:

- speaker body: small rectangle `x+4,y+10,w=5,h=6`
- speaker horn: triangle/polygon from `(x+9,y+10)`, `(x+14,y+6)`, `(x+14,y+20)`, `(x+9,y+16)`
- sound waves: two curved connectors or arcs on the right, no fill

If arcs are hard in the target generator, use two short curved connectors with `curved=1;endArrow=none`.

## Video

Meaning: video stream, playback, temporal input.

Cells:

- rounded frame: `x+3,y+5,w=18,h=14`
- top clapper stripe: thin rectangle or alternating dark small bars at `y+5`
- play triangle: centered triangle inside the frame

Keep the play triangle direction consistent with the reference.

## Retrieval

Meaning: retrieval document, search, external lookup.

Cells:

- small document rectangle at `x+3,y+4,w=12,h=15`
- magnifier lens: ellipse `x+12,y+12,w=7,h=7`
- handle: diagonal line from `(x+18,y+18)` to `(x+22,y+22)`

Avoid replacing retrieval with a plain database icon unless the reference uses a database cylinder.

## Tools

Meaning: tools, APIs, actions, external utilities.

Cells:

- wrench approximation: diagonal thick line with small open circle at one end
- screwdriver approximation: crossing diagonal line with small rectangular handle
- optional sparkle/dot if the reference uses a tool-call marker

For tiny icons, a crossed-tools primitive is clearer than detailed teeth.

## Stacked Memory

Meaning: memory bank, cache, slots, layered storage.

Cells:

- three rounded rectangles offset by `(2,2)`, each `w=16,h=6`
- back layers use lighter fill; front layer uses the primary memory color
- optional tiny label block inside the front rectangle

Use this for working cache, episodic memory, semantic memory, and key-value packets.

## Clock Or Temporal Trace

Meaning: time, temporal traces, history.

Cells:

- circle `x+4,y+4,w=16,h=16`
- hour hand line from center to `(x+12,y+8)`
- minute hand line from center to `(x+16,y+12)`
- optional tiny tick marks at top/right/bottom/left

Keep hands simple; detailed clock faces blur at paper-figure scale.

## Warning

Meaning: risk, alert, context growth warning.

Cells:

- triangle outline or filled pale red triangle
- exclamation mark as text or a vertical line plus dot

Use a red/orange stroke, but keep it consistent with the figure palette.

## Gauge Or Uncertainty

Meaning: score, uncertainty, routing confidence.

Cells:

- semicircle arc or curved connector from left to right
- small tick marks on the arc
- needle line from center to upper-right
- optional small center dot

If draw.io arc geometry is unreliable, use three short curved connectors to approximate the semicircle.

## Primitive Icon Ledger Entry

Record each icon family in `asset-ledger.md`:

```markdown
| id | built from | fidelity notes |
| image_stream_icon | primitive-icons.md image recipe; rectangle, dot, mountain polyline | editable approximation; no source bitmap available |
```

If the reference uses a branded logo, molecule, neural-network symbol, or paper-specific mark that these recipes cannot capture, do not force-fit it. Mark it as an approximation or missing asset and ask for the source if exact fidelity matters.
